# Bubblesort Speed Comparison
There's a article detailing that PHP is slower than NodeJS where the author
attempts to use bubble-sort as the base comparison.

However, I feel his implementation is flawed, thus, I'm using one from an
algorithms and datastructures paper on bubblesort. I've adapted the psuedocode
to PHP and NodeJS and have found PHP to be *much* faster than Node.

If I've made a mistake in time calculations, please let me know, and I'll
correct the issue.

Thanks!
